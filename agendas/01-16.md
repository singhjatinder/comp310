January 16 agenda
=================

Our first lab!

In this lab, create a linked list implementation that doesn't use the exising linked list class in Java. The starter code is available in source folder `src/main/java`, package `edu.wit.comp310.lab1`, class `MyLinkedList`. There is also some test code folder `src/test/java`, package `edu.wit.comp310.lab1`, class `MyLinkedListTest`.

I don't expect that you will completely implement all of the linked list implementation in one sitting. So, the code is not due until January 30. That said, don't wait until January 29 to get started. That's what lab time is for. :-)

You will know your implementation is working properly when you try to run MyLinkedListTest. If the tests pass, the JUnit runner will be green. Otherwise, it will be red.
