January 30 agenda
=================

Create a map (dictionary) backed by a linked list first, then we'll make a map backed by a balanced binary search tree (AVL tree).
The starter code is in `edu.wit.comp310.lab2'. As before, there will be some test code (it's not cooked yet).

The code is not due until February 13. Start early. Commit and push often. :-)

You will know your implementation is working properly when you try to run MyLinkedListTest. If the tests pass, the JUnit runner will be green. Otherwise, it will be red. (You'll see a test suite later)
